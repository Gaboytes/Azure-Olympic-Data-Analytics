# Azure-Olympic-Data-Analytics


### Introduction 
This project was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge of Azure Data Engineering and learn new skills along the way. Exploring and going through different services in Azure Cloud.

### About Dataset
This Dataset contains real information about the last olympic games that took place in Tokyo 2021  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo)

 ### Services Used

1. **Azure Data Factory**: Started the project by using Azure Data Factory to orchestrate the data integration process. It allowed me to efficiently to build the pipeline and ensure a smooth flow throughout the pipeline.

2. **Data Lake Storage**: Raw data was stored securely in Azure Data Lake Gen 2, providing us with a centralized repository to work with. The flexibility of Data Lake allowed me to easily manage and scale as needed.

3. **Azure Databricks**: To clean and transform the data, Azure Databricks is used. It's incredible how this platform simplifies data engineering tasks to wrangle data with ease.

4. **Data Lake Gen 2**: The transformed data found its home back in Data Lake Storage, now enriched and ready for the next step.

5.  **Power BI & Blob Storage**: We connected the dots by linking Power BI to the data via Blob Storage. This setup enabled real-time access to our curated dataset.

6.  **Power Query Magic**: In Power BI, i used the mighty Power Query to further refine the data, ensuring it was in its finest form for visualization.

7.  **Visual Dashboard**: Finally, we brought the Tokyo Olympics 2020 data to life with a stunning visual dashboard in Power BI. From medals tally to athlete statistics, our dashboard encapsulates the essence of the event.
